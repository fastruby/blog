Next week the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) community is having the biggest event of the year, the [Rails Conf 2019](https://railsconf.com/). We participated in previous editions of this conference but this time we have the honor to be on the speakers side of it. We'll be teaching you what we're best at: [Rails Upgrades](https://fastruby.io/blog/tags/upgrades).

At [Fast Ruby](https://fastruby.io/) we have been doing Rails Upgrades for many years. This has allowed us to work on all kind of projects. From tiny [MVP's](https://fastruby.io/minimum-viable-product) to huge [monolith](https://fastruby.io/monolith) applications.

During the 2-hour [workshop](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-776) you will learn a proven Rails upgrade process for major and minor version changes of Rails.
We will teach you how you can [evaluate](https://fastruby.io/blog/upgrade-rails/legacy-rails-silently-judging-you.html) a Rails application before considering upgrading it. What tools you should use to make the upgrade easier. What the main things are that you should address on every upgrade. And much more.
You will leave this workshop with a roadmap to upgrade your Rails application.

If you're going to Rails Conf and are interested in attending our workshop, you can book your place [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-upgrade-rails-101-the-roadmap-to-smooth-upgrades-tickets-60333391799).

Hope to see you there!
