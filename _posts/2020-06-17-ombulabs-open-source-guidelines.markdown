At OmbuLabs we dedicate some of our work hours to open source every week. Also some of us contribute to open source during our spare time.

Here are a few tips to help us keep our OSS contributions organized and encourage people to contribute

<!--more-->

From now on every-time we contribute to an OSS project in working hours, we fork it to the [FastRuby.io organization](https://github.com/fastruby).

This way we can keep track of the contributions we made as a company, also the branches created in the project are accessible to the rest of the team.

As a company we get these benefits:

\- We use OSS projects and we want them to be better

\- Our brand to be associated with these OSS projects

\- Our teammates to learn more about these projects

\- Our contributions to be noticed

\- To use our contributions in the future

\- Sometimes contributions take a long time to be merged into the main OSS project. This way we make sure that we include references to our company’s organization.

\- None of our references will point to a person’s repository. They will point to one of our company’s fork.

As an individual, we get these benefits:

\- Display the user in the PR page

\- Display the contribution in the user's contribution graph

\- Display commits authored by the original user

# README

When creating a new OSS project these are some important things it must have:
- Description of the project
- Steps on how to setup the project
- A contributing guide
- A code of conduct

# Steps on how to setup the project

In this section we should describe the steps needed to get project up and running, some of the common things are:
- External Dependencies of the project
- Any task runner command to setup external services
- Instructions to run automated tests
- Setup configuration files
- Environment variables


# A contributing guide
In this section we should document standards and steps to contribute to our project, some common things to include are:
- Branch naming
- What is the main branch where feature and hotfix branches should branch of
The git flow that we chose for the project
- If we are using an issue tracker, how would we link the PR with a story or issue


# Sponsorship

In projects that we create and we dedicate time on it we include the following banners.

# Code Of Conduct

We want a welcoming, inclusive and harassment free space to contribute, thats why we decided to include the \[code of conduct\](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) in all our projects.

# Licence

We choose the MIT license for our projects becuase is open source friendly and bussiness friendly.

It allows us to use our code for comercial purposes but is also very permessive so other people can also take advantage of what we build.
