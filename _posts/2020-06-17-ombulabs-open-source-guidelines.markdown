At OmbuLabs we dedicate some of our work hours to open source every week. Also some of us contribute to open source during our spare time.

Here are a few tips to that help us keep OSS contributions organized

<!--more-->

From now on every-time we contribute to an OSS project in working hours, we fork it to the [FastRuby.io organization](https://github.com/fastruby).

This way we can keep track of the contributions we made as a company, also the branches created in the project are accessible to the rest of the team.

As a company we get these benefits:

\- We use OSS projects and we want them to be better

\- We want our brand to be associated with these OSS projects

\- We want our teammates to learn more about these projects

\- We want our contributions to be noticed

\- We want to use our contributions in the future

\- Sometimes contributions take a long time to be merged into the main OSS project. This way we make sure that we include references to our company’s organization.

\- None of our references will point to a person’s repository. They will point to one of our company’s fork.

As an individual we get to keep the benefits too.

\- Display the user in the PR page

\- Display the contribution in the user's contribution graph

\- Display commits authored by the original user

# README

When creating a new OSS project it is good to have a good README. The readme should include steps on how to install the project, if you want to contribute it should have steps on how to contribute to their projects and a code of conduct

# Sponsorship

In projects that we create and we dedicate time on it we include the following banners.

# Code Of Conduct

We want a welcoming, inclusive and harassment free space to contribute, thats why we decided to include the \[code covenant\](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) in all our projects.

# Licence

We choose the MIT license for our projects becuase is open source friendly and bussiness friendly.

It allows us to use our code for comercial purposes but is also very permessive so other people can also take advantage of what we build.
