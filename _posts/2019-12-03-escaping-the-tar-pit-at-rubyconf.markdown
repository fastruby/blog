This year I had the honor to speak at [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org) in Nashville.
It was my second time attending the conference and first time as a speaker. I
talked about `skunk`, a gem to [calculate the StinkScore](https://github.com/fastruby/skunk)
of a module or set of modules.

Since its inception, `skunk` has changed quite a bit based on real usage in
our [productized service for Rails upgrades](https://fastruby.io). As a matter
of fact, the night before my talk I realized there was a **BIG error in our
formula**.

Here is a description of the problem and solution.

<!--more-->

I was doing some tests the night before my talk and noticed unexpected
results using [Skunk version 0.3.0](https://github.com/fastruby/skunk/tree/v0.3.0).
In my example, I wanted to show that simplifying a messy piece of code should show
me an improvement in the stink score average.

The problem was that as much as I improved the code, the stink score average would
only go up. This meant that the metric was _lying to me_. (**And I was like WTF?!?!**)

This is the project that I used for my example: [https://github.com/fastruby/gggiiifff.com](https://github.com/fastruby/gggiiifff.com). It is an open source [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
application that basically consumes the [Giphy](https://www.giphy.com) API to
find the gifs you are looking for.

When I ran `skunk` on this project, I got this summary:

```
StinkScore Total: 0.71
Modules Analysed: 6
StinkScore Average: 0.11833333333333333
Worst StinkScore: 0.71 (models/query.rb)
```

In my test, I was trying to reduce complexity for the most complicated file
(`models/query.rb`) by [removing code from that file]((https://github.com/fastruby/gggiiifff.com/commit/d6195a8d6f46d194f9c51c49e30b5e5ba5cdb803)) (yes, I know that if I remove these
lines the application stops working, but it was a change to prove a concept)

In theory, removing methods from a module will improve its stink score because
then we have less code to maintain. ([read more here](https://www.fastruby.io/blog/code-quality/intruducing-skunk-stink-score-calculator.html) to know how it works)

In practice, I was seeing the StinkScore get worse with every _`git commit`_:

```
Base branch (master) average stink score: 62.771
Feature branch (skunk-v-0-3-0) average stink score: 62.791
Score: 62.79
```

The formula for `AnalysedModule#stink_score` in [Skunk v0.3.0](https://github.com/fastruby/skunk/tree/v0.3.0)
looks like this:

```ruby
def stink_score
  return churn_times_cost.round(2) if coverage == PERFECT_COVERAGE

  (churn_times_cost * (PERFECT_COVERAGE - coverage.to_i)).round(2)
end

# @return [Integer]
def churn_times_cost
  safe_churn = churn.positive? ? churn : 1
  @churn_times_cost ||= safe_churn * cost
end
```

The problem with this is that `churn` should not be considered when you are trying
to improve the stink score, because `churn` has too much weight when calculating
the stink score. If we were to include `churn` in the formula, we should make
that value weigh less.

## One Example: Reducing Complexity

It might be easier to see this with an example. Let's say that we have a module
with a cost of 1000 and code coverage at 50%. Let's say that we make 7 changes
to the module and we reduce the cost by 100 each time.

This is what the `stink_score` over time looks like:

<img src="/blog/assets/images/skunk-v0-3-0-graph.png" alt="Churn vs. Stink Score and Cost with Skunk v0.3.0">

Every change that you make, reducing the cost by 100, is actually making the
stink score worse.

So, the night before my [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org) talk, I decided it
would be best to remove `churn` from the stink score formula.

This is what `AnalysedModule#stink_score` looks like in [Skunk v0.3.1](https://github.com/fastruby/skunk/blob/v0.3.1/lib/skunk/rubycritic/analysed_module.rb):

```ruby
def stink_score
  return cost.round(2) if coverage == PERFECT_COVERAGE

  (cost * (PERFECT_COVERAGE - coverage.to_i)).round(2)
end
```

It is pretty straight-forward: There is only one penalty factor which is
relative to the lack of code coverage in the module.

Using this new formula and the same example, this is what the `stink_score` over
time looks like:

<img src="/blog/assets/images/skunk-v0-3-1-graph.png" alt="Churn vs. Stink Score and Cost with Skunk v0.3.1">

Now that looks more like what I expected!

## Code Coverage Improvements

What does it look like if we make 4 changes to increase code coverage by 10%
in every change?

If we are using version 0.3.0, this is what the `stink_score` looks like:

<img src="/blog/assets/images/skunk-v0-3-0-coverage-graph.png"
     alt="Churn vs. Stink Score and Cost with Skunk v0.3.0">

If we are using version 0.3.1, this is what the `stink_score` looks like:

<img src="/blog/assets/images/skunk-v0-3-1-coverage-graph.png"
     alt="Churn vs. Stink Score and Cost with Skunk v0.3.1">

Now the stink score average makes more sense. ü§ì

Fortunately I managed to fix my slides in time for my talk! You can watch my
presentation at RubyConf over here:

## Conclusion

I believe there is a lot of value in comparing stink scores between one branch
and another. **Getting out of the tar pit is no easy feat.** You want to make sure
that you're always making changes that get you one step closer to a truly
easy-to-maintain project.

In the roadmap for Skunk, I'm really excited about a feature that will keep track
of the stink score average over time. **This metric can be our compass in this
adventure out of the tar pit.** If you see the average going up over time, you
will know there is something wrong with your team.

In order to keep improving the tool, I plan to run it using well-established,
open source, Ruby and Rails codebases. Which stink score do you want to see
first? Let me know in the comments below! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## SolidusConf

The presentation I gave at [SolidusConf](https://conf.solidus.io) was based on
Skunk v0.3.0, so there is a mistake in this presentation:

I'm sorry about that, [@SolidusConf](https://twitter.com/SolidusIO) and attendees!
The good news is that it is a small mistake. It doesn't change much about the
core of my talk.
